In the file busy-waiting, process2 is waiting for process to give the signal then only process2 can enter the critical
section, here process2 is continously waiting for process1 to give signal (signal()). 
here cpu time of process2 has been wasted in waiting.

Busy-waiting itself can be made much less wasteful by using a delay function (e.g., sleep()) found in most
operating systems. This puts a thread to sleep for a specified time, during which the thread will waste no CPU time.
If the loop is checking something simple then it will spend most of its time asleep and will waste very little CPU time.

In programs that never end (such as operating systems), infinite busy waiting can be implemented by using 
unconditional jumps.
