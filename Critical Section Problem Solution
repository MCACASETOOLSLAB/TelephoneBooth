Solution for critical section problem
Here in this html page we are explaning the solution for critical section problem using semaphores,busywaiting and spin lock

Customer1 wants to access the critical section when he access the critical section he calls the wait function.Now process two waits until process1 (customer1 ) sends the signal.Process2 i.e customer2 checks the critical section continuosly in order to enter in the critical section.This continuosly testing a variable until some value appear is called busy waiting.
                        The process2(cutomer2) is able to enter in the telephone booth only when process1(cutomer1)  finishes his work in critical section and pass the signal.
                       A lock that uses busy waiting is called spin lock.
          Busy waiting should be avoide because it wastes CPU time. Only when there is reasonable expectation that the wait will be short is busy waiting used.
